# Sources and verification record

Research date: **2026-09-18**. Public primary documentation was inspected; selected Vesper files were read through the connected GitHub tool. Live Codex/Claude execution, account access, cost measurements, and GitHub automation were **not** tested. Models, capabilities, pricing, and CLI schemas can change; runtime verification is an installation requirement.

The kit's architecture, role split, thresholds, permissions proposal, and model routing are recommendations. The sources below support platform facts, not proof that this system is empirically optimal.

## Selected Vesper observations (example only)

Read `.claude/agents/vesper-builder.md`, `.codex/agents/vesper-builder.toml`, `.agents/skills/vesper-agent-build/SKILL.md`, and directory listings for `.claude`/`.codex` in `ceponatia/vesper` on the research date.

The builder definitions repeat essentially the same behavior across two native formats, while the skills directory already uses shared sources with Claude symlinks. Useful patterns include scoped briefs, path ownership, preserved escalation records, acceptance evidence, and a distinction between implementation and PR handling. The inspected builder prohibits local application checks and escalates after its first failed attempt; this kit does not import those as universal rules. Those may reflect Vesper-specific environment constraints and require separate evaluation.

This was not a full repository audit, hook-security assessment, runtime compatibility test, or efficiency benchmark. No Vesper file, branch, issue, PR, label, or setting was changed.
